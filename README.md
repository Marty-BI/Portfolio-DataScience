# Hi, I'm Martijn ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! I'm passionate about using **data**, **statistics**, and **machine learning** to solve real-world problems. I primarily work with **R** and love creating insights through analysis, models, and visualizations.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- R (tidyverse, caret, randomForest, ggplot2, Shiny)
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- SQL
- Git & GitHub
- Data Visualization & Storytelling

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects:
- [**Customer Behavior Analysis in R**](https://github.com/Marty-BI/Portfolio-DataScience/tree/1b172a3c2b7ffd0a1026f52eecfda9540fcab349/Data%20Science%20Projects/Project%20x%20-%20Thesis%20-%20Customer%20Behavior%20Analysis)
  *This project has been created due to my MSc Thesis. This project analyses purchasing behavior across multiple retail datasets using advanced causal interference techniques. The main goal was to track the loyalty behavior of customers before and during a loyalty program to measure the causal effects. Used techniques were: Difference-in-Difference (DiD), Augmentend Difference-in-Difference (ADiD), and Synthetic Difference-in-Difference(SDiD).*

- [**Customer Churn Prediction in R**](link-to-project)  
  *Predicting telecom customer churn using machine learning models in R.*

- [**Time Series Forecasting**](link-to-project)  
  *Forecasting sales data using ARIMA and Prophet models.*

- [**Shiny Dashboard for EDA**](link-to-project)  
  *Interactive dashboard to explore datasets visually.*
